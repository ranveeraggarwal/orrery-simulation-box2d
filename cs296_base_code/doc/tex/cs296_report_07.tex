\chapter*{Introduction}
An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system device that illustrates the relative sizes, positions, and motions of the planets and moons according to the heliocentric model.

Though the Greeks had working planetaria, the first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704, and one was presented to the Earl of Orrery â€” whence came the name. They are typically driven by a clockwork mechanism with a globe representing the Sun at the centre, and with a planet at the end of each of the arms.
